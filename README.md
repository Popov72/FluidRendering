**Note: this repo is now in read-only mode, as the fluid renderer has been added to Babylon.js since v5.36.0**

This is an implementation of this paper from Simon Green (NVIDIA): https://developer.download.nvidia.com/presentations/2010/gdc/Direct3D_Effects.pdf

It also features a basic fluid simulator in some of the demos.
